### Useful tips

**Stepmax** simply caps the level of computational resources available to the algorithm.

**Learningrate** determines how much each observation affects node weighting.

**Algorithm** determines the way the neural network learns.

**Lifesign** tells r how much to display during the calculation.

**rprop+** is similar to back propagation, but its faster (as it does not require tuning) and requires no parameter as opposed to back-prop. Though, its more complex than back-prop.
